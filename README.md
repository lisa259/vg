## Video Game Ontology Notebook

Using the knowledge we obtained from the Knowledge and Data course, we were able
to create a data visualization application which contains an analysis of a
dataset about video games. Our application is presented in the form of
visualizations in this jupyter notebook.

Our submitted notebook is saved in such a manner that all the desired outputs
have been displayed. Do note that an active internet connection is required, and
the notebook needs to be trusted (File -\> Trust Notebook) in order to display
the map in section 4. Please follow the guide below in the case you want to
**run the notebook** yourself.

For our notebook, we made use of GraphDB repositories and JupyterLab, which runs
on Python 3. We made use of the python libraries ipython_sparql_pandas, pandas,
seaborn, matplotlib and folium. Please be sure to have these packages installed
in order to be able to run the jupyter notebook.
    
   
## Installation

**GraphDB Installation**

To have a local repository, install the GraphDB application:
<https://www.ontotext.com/products/graphdb/graphdb-free/>

**Python Installation**

You need to have at least Python 3.8 installed on your computer and you can find
all the information: https://www.python.org/downloads/. To check if python is
installed, run the following command on your local terminal:

enter the following command:

python -V

**Jupyter Installation**

You can find a complete installation documentation of jupyter on
https://jupyter.org/install. Make sure to install pip from
https://pip.pypa.io/en/stable/installation/. Jupyterlab is used to access the
notebook.

**Jupyterlab Installation**

For a local installation on the terminal run:

​​\$ pip install jupyterlab

**Access the jupyter lab**

Running in a local installation:

​​\$ jupyter lab

**Package Installation**

To make the graphs visible, make sure all necessary python libraries are
installed, if any are missing, run:

\$ pip install pandas

\$ pip install ipython-sparql-pandas

\$ pip install folium

\$ pip install seaborn

\$ pip install matplotlib
   
   
## Running our notebook

1.  Be sure to have Jupyterlab, Python, GraphDB installed

2.  Create a local repository on GraphDB

3.  Import the turtle file into the GraphDB repository -- VideoGame.ttl .

4.  Open Jupyter from your local terminal.

5.  Have access to our notebook file --
    K&D_Final_Project_Notebook_Group_28.ipnyb .

6.  Make sure all necessary packages are installed with pip. (See above)

7.  In the notebook, replace the url endpoint in all queries with your graphDB
    endpoint.

8.  Run the cells in the specified order to get all the results.
